excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose an Attribute-Aware Argumentative Recommender ($A^3R$) that combines factorization-based methods and argumentation. With the help of argumentation framework, each step of $A^3R$ is endowed with explicit semantics, enabling $A^3R$ to generate easily understandable explanations for recommendations.'

This paper proposes an Attribute-Aware Argumentative Recommender ($A^3R$) that combines factorization-based methods and argumentation. With the help of the argumentation framework, each step of $A^3R$ is endowed with explicit semantics, enabling $A^3R$ to generate easily understandable explanations for recommendations.
