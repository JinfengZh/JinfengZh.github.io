I'm currently Postdoctoral Researcher at [CEREMADE](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/fr.html) of [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/). In collaboration with [Pr. Emmanuel Bacry](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bacry/) and [Pr. Jean-françois Muzy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jf-muzy-a2b9b241/?originalSubdomain=fr), we analyze and model the behaviors of the various agents involved in the same financial market as well as their interaction dynamics. To achieve this, we are fortunate to have access to an exceptionally rich database. This dataset is provided by Euronext (which owns the main market in the eurozone) and includes a complete historical record over several years of all orders placed in the order book of each of the 40 CAC40 stocks, as well as all orders placed in the order book of the futures contracts on the CAC40 index itself.

Previous that, I serve as Temporary Lecturer and Research Assistant at [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/). I successfully defended my Ph.D. thesis on the 30th of November (supervised by [Elsa NEGRE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~negre/)).  The focus of my thesis was [Generality and Explainability in Recommender Systems](https://www.theses.fr/2023UPSLD036), a topic that resonates strongly within the field of artificial intelligence.

Before joining [LAMSADE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/en.html) for my doctoral studies, I pursued a Master's degree at [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/) and completed my engineering education at [AgroParisTech](https://synapses.agroparistech.fr/catalogue/2022-2023/parcours/201/IDF3A-IODAA-de-l-information-a-la-decision-par-l-analyse-et-l-apprentissage), under the guidance of [Antoine CORNUEJOLS](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Antoine-Cornuejols) and [Juliette Dibie](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Juliette-Dibie). My academic path commenced with a Bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests are deeply rooted in artificial intelligence, focusing on general explainability and interpretability. This includes specialized areas like argumentation for explainable recommendations, counterfactual reasoning in the context of explainable recommendations, and methodologies for evaluating explanations, Deep learning for strategy detection (including spoofing) in equity anf future index.

I am always open to engaging in insightful discussions, collaborations, and opportunities in my field. Please feel free to connect with me via email at jinfeng.zhong@dauphine.eu or explore more about my work and interests on my personal webpage at https://jinfengzh.github.io/.
