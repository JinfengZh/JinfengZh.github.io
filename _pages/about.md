I'm currently a third-year PhD student in [LAMSADE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/en.html) of [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/), under the supervision of [Elsa NEGRE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~negre/). The subject of PhD thesis is **"Generality ad explainability in recommender systems"**. Before joining [LAMSADE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/en.html), I obtained my Master's degree from [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/) and my engineer's degree (Ingénieur in French) from [AgroParisTech](https://synapses.agroparistech.fr/catalogue/2022-2023/parcours/201/IDF3A-IODAA-de-l-information-a-la-decision-par-l-analyse-et-l-apprentissage) under the supervision of [Antoine CORNUEJOLS](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Antoine-Cornuejols) and [Juliette Dibie](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Juliette-Dibie). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interest focuses on the general explainability and interpretability in AI; argumentation for explainable recommendations; counterfactual reasoning for explainable recommendations; evaluation of explanations. Feel free to drop me a mail at jinfeng.zhong@dauphine.eu
