### About Me

I am an **Assistant Professor (Maître de conférences)** in Computer Science at the **University of Paris 8**, affiliated with the [LIASD laboratory](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/UR-Laboratoire-d-Intelligence-Artificielle-et-Semantique-des-Donnees-LIASD).

Previously, I was a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at [CEREMADE](https://www.ceremade.dauphine.fr/fr.html), [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/), where I collaborated with [Pr. Emmanuel Bacry](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~bacry/) and [Pr. Jean-François Muzy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jf-muzy-a2b9b241/?originalSubdomain=fr). My research focused on analyzing and modeling the behaviors of financial market agents and their interaction dynamics, using a unique Euronext dataset comprising several years of complete order-book histories for all CAC40 stocks and CAC40 index futures.

Earlier, I served as a **Temporary Lecturer and Research Assistant** at [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/). I defended my Ph.D. thesis, supervised by [Elsa NEGRE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/~negre/), on **Generality and Explainability in Recommender Systems** ([manuscript](https://www.theses.fr/2023UPSLD036)).

Before joining [LAMSADE](https://www.lamsade.dauphine.fr/en.html) for my doctoral studies, I earned a **Master’s degree** at [Université Paris Dauphine-PSL](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/) and completed my **engineering degree** at [AgroParisTech](https://synapses.agroparistech.fr/catalogue/2022-2023/parcours/201/IDF3A-IODAA-de-l-information-a-la-decision-par-l-analyse-et-l-apprentissage), under the guidance of [Antoine CORNUEJOLS](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Antoine-Cornuejols) and [Juliette Dibie](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Equipes/Membres/Juliette-Dibie). My academic path began with a **Bachelor’s degree** at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

My research interests are rooted in **artificial intelligence**, with a focus on **explainability and interpretability**. I work on argumentation-based approaches for explainable recommendations, counterfactual reasoning, and methodologies for evaluating explanations. In parallel, I develop **deep learning methods for financial market microstructure analysis**, particularly for detecting strategies such as spoofing in equities and index futures.

I welcome opportunities for academic exchange and collaboration. You can reach me at **[jinfeng.zhong@univ-paris8.fr](mailto:jinfeng.zhong@univ-paris8.fr)**.
